# Timecycle Changer for GTA SA

This small .asi modification for GTA San Andreas makes it possible to switch easily and quickly between multiple timecycles while in game.

## Usage

Import all .cpp and .h files to Visual Studio and compile. You can also download a ready-to-use .asi file.

Put timecyc.asi and timecyc.ini into your GTA SA directory or scripts directory. 
An ASI loader is needed to inject the modification into your game. Preferred ASI loaders are Silent ASI Loader and Ultimate ASI Loader.
Name your timecycles appropriately (timecyc1.dat, timecyc2.dat, ...) and put them into the data directory.
The .ini file is not needed to run the modification but lets you enable info about current timecycle and remap your switch key.

Default switch key in case you haven't included the .ini file is mapped as F9.
